                  This program represents a robust implementation of a doubly linked list data structure with a range of versatile 
                  features. Upon initialization, an empty doubly linked list is created, and it keeps track of both the head and tail 
                  pointers while maintaining a count of the lists length. This foundational structure allows for efficient and dynamic
                   data management.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  One noteworthy feature is the ability to traverse the list using list iterators created with the begin() and end() 
                  functions. This simplifies element access and iteration. The code also ensures proper memory management through the 
                  _destroy() function, which deallocates memory associated with each node, guarding against memory leaks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  The code offers powerful operations such as insertion at both the front and back of the list, as well as the option 
                  to split the list at a specified point. Furthermore, it includes functions for list reversal and block reversal, 
                  providing flexibility in list manipulation tasks. Additionally, the mergeWith function facilitates the merging of 
                  two sorted lists while maintaining their sorted order. Finally, the code employs the efficient merge sort algorithm
                   for sorting the list, which is known for its stability and excellent performance. Collectively, these features make
                    the code a valuable tool for managing and manipulating doubly linked lists in various applications, offering a 
                    strong foundation for efficient data organization and processing.
